<p>I argued that it was 
3
not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I
would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous
happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful
conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.
I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only
soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would
undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished,
should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.
Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the
fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse
coming of night.
The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in
the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some
children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.
A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. One of them
asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?" Without waiting for my
answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if
you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad." I threw them a
coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a
slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the
branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep
me company.
For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my
desperate intent. At once I realized that this would be impossible. The advice about
turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for
finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know something about
labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was Governor of
Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than
there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose
themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was
assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his
labyrinth.
Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I
imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I
imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite,
made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers,
provinces and kingdoms . . . I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing
maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the
stars.
Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted. For an
undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract
spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the
evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel
fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite. The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight.
A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the
breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.
I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of
other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens,
streams, or the West wind.
Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an
avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion.
Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible:
the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had
accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there
was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The
stuttering sparks of the music kept on.
But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a
lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by
the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the
moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me.
He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.
"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude.
No doubt you want to see the garden?"
Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.
"The garden?"
"The garden of forking paths."
Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:
"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."
"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."

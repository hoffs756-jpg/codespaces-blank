<h1> The book of sands</h1>
<p>....I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on Belgrano Street,
in Buenos Aires. Late one evening, a few months back, I
heard a knock at my door. I opened it and a stranger stood
there. He was a tall man, with nondescript features — or
perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem that way.
Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he
had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he
was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I
realize that I had been misled by his thin blond hair, which
was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the
course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, I
found out that he came from the Orkneys.</p>

<h1> The Circular Ruins</h1>
<p>The purpose which guided him was not impossible, though supernatural. He
wanted to dream a man; he wanted to dream him in minute entirety and
impose him on reality. This magic project had exhausted the entire expanse of
his mind; if someone had asked him his name or to relate some event of his
former life, he would not have been able to give an answer. This uninhabited,
ruined temple suited him, for it is contained a minimum of visible world; the
proximity of the workmen also suited him, for they took it upon themselves
to provide for his frugal needs. The rice and fruit they brought him were
nourishment enough for his body, which was consecrated to the sole task of
sleeping and dreaming.</p>

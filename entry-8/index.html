<p>. . . and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in
German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's
office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter,
or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that
Runeberg had been arrested or murdered.i
 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran
the same risk. Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged
to be implacable. An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal
feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this
extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two
agents of Imperial Germany? I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, 
I closed and locked the door. I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. The
never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the
sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be
that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a
child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?
Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century
follows century, and things happen only in the present. There are countless men in
the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me . . . The almost
unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering
thoughts.<p>
  
  
<p>In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak
of terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, now that my neck hankers for
the hangman's noose), I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did
not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of the exact site of the new
British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and,
absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of
France, shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only my mouth, before
it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that it could be
heard in Germany . . . My voice, my human voice, was weak. How could it reach the
ear of the Chief? The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of
Runeberg or of me except that we were in Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his arid Berlin office,
leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from
us. I said aloud, "I must flee."</p>

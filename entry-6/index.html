  <h1>The Circular Ruins</h1>

  <p>
   No one saw him disembark in the
unanimous night, no one saw the bamboo
canoe sink into the sacred mud, but in a few
days there was no one who did not know
that the taciturn man came from the South
and that his home had been one of those
numberless villages upstream in the deeply
cleft side of the mountain, where the Zend
language has not been contaminated by
Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What
is certain is that the grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with
pushing aside (probably, without feeling) the blades which were lacerating
his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to the circular
enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse, which sometimes was the
color of flame and now was that of ashes. This circle was a temple which had
been devoured by ancient fires, profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose
god no longer received the homage of men. The stranger stretched himself
out beneath the pedestal. He was awakened by the sun high overhead. He
was not astonished to find that his wounds had healed; he closed his pallid
eyes and slept, not through weakness of flesh but through determination of
will. He knew that this temple was the place required for his invincible
intent; he knew that the incessant trees had not succeeded in strangling the
ruins of another propitious temple downstream which had once belonged to
gods now burned and dead; he knew that his immediate obligation was to
dream. Toward midnight he was awakened by the inconsolable shriek of a
bird. Tracks of bare feet, some figs and a jug warned him that the men of the
region had been spying respectfully on his sleep, soliciting his protection or
afraid of his magic. He felt a chill of fear, and sought out a sepulchral niche
in the dilapidated wall where he concealed himself among unfamiliar

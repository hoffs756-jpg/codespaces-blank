    <h1>The Garden of Forking Paths</h1>


<p>In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that a
planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen hundred
artillery pieces, against the German line at Serre-Montauban, scheduled for July 24,
1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments that
torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance. The following
deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher
of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, casts unsuspected light upon this event. The
first two pages are missing.

. . . and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in
German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's
office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter,
or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that
Runeberg had been arrested or murdered.i
 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran
the same risk. Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged
to be implacable. An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal
feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this
extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two
agents of Imperial Germany?</p>

<p>I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the
door. I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. The
never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the
sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be
that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a
child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?
Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century
follows century, and things happen only in the present. There are countless men in
the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me . . . The almost
unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering
thoughts.
In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak
of terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, now that my neck hankers for
the hangman's noose), I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did
not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of the exact site of the new
British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and,
absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of
France, shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only my mouth, before
it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that it could be
heard in Germany . . . My voice, my human voice, was weak. How could it reach the
ear of the Chief? The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of
Runeberg or of me except that we were in Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his 
2
arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from
us. I said aloud, "I must flee."</p>

<p>I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering
at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself -
made me empty out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find. The
American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the
useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I
decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two
single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a
revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give
myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.
In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name
of the one person capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of
Fenton, less than half an hour away by train.
I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky
plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was
terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous country is of no
importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy.
Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as
Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he
was Goethe.
I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of
those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him
that a yellow man could save his armies. Besides, I had to escape the Captain. His
hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door.
Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked
a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but
I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of
being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and
vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out
with a painful and deliberate slowness.
I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. The
train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go
until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the
carriages. I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in
Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier. At last the train pulled out. A man I 
recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, 
trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.
From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that
the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my
adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of
fate. I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was
not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I
would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous
happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful
conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.</p>

<p>I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only
soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would
undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished,
should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.
Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the
fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse
coming of night.
The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in
the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some
children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.
A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. One of them
asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?" Without waiting for my
answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if
you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad." I threw them a
coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a
slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the
branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep
me company.
For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my
desperate intent. At once I realized that this would be impossible. The advice about
turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for
finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know something about
labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was Governor of
Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than
there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose
themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was
assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his
labyrinth.
Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I
imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I
imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite,
made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers,
provinces and kingdoms . . . I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing
maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the
stars. Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted. For an
undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract
spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the
evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel
fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite. The road kept descending and branching off,
through meadows misty in the twilight.
A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the
breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.
I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of
other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens,
streams, or the West wind.
Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an
avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion.
Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible:
the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had
accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there
was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The
stuttering sparks of the music kept on.
But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a
lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by
the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the
moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me.</p>

<p>He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.
"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude.
No doubt you want to see the garden?"
Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.
"The garden?"
"The garden of forking paths."
Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:
"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."
"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."</p>

  <h1>The Garden of Forking Paths</h1>

  <p>
    In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that a
    planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen hundred
    artillery pieces, against the German line at Serre-Montauban, scheduled for July 24,
    1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments that
    torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance. The following
    deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher
    of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, casts unsuspected light upon this event. The
    first two pages are missing.

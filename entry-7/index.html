<h1>The Book of Sand</h1>
<p>The line is made up of an infinite number of points; the
plane of an infinite number of lines; the volume of an infinite
number of planes; the hypervolume of an infinite number of
volumes. No, unquestionably this is not — more geometrico
— the best way of beginning my story. To claim that is it true
is nowadays the convention of every made-up story. Mine,
however,
  <a href="https://hoffs756-jpg.github.io/codespaces-blank/entry-11/"
   class="persistent-highlight">is true.</a>
I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on Belgrano Street,
in Buenos Aires. Late one evening, a few months back, I
heard a knock at my door. I opened it and a stranger stood
there. He was a tall man, with nondescript features — or
perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem that way.
Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he
had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he
was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I
realize that I had been misled by his thin blond hair, which
was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the
course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, I
found out that he came from the Orkneys. I invited him in, pointing to a chair. 
He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of gloom emanated from him — as it
does now from me. "I sell Bibles," he said.
Somewhat pedantically, I replied, "In this house are
several English Bibles, including the first - John Wicliffe's. I
also have Cipriano de Valera's, Luther's — which, from a
literary viewpoint, is the worst — and a Latin copy of the
Vulgate. As you see, it's not exactly Bibles I stand in need of" </p>
